# Rock, paper scissors!

This website gives you the opportunity to play rock, paper, scissors against your electronic device. The layout is easy to read and you will see how the score develops during the time you play, both as wins, draws and losses.  You can also see the rules for the game at the bottom of the page. It's a classic game that's been around for a long time so most people know how to play it.
